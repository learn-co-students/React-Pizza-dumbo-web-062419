✅ After firing up your server, render the list of pizzas in to the table.

✅ Each row in the table should be a pizza component and when you click the "Edit" button, it should send the pizza associated with that component into the Pizza form.

✅ The pizza form will then render the information about the pizza in the form, which will be editable.

* When the form is submitted, the information should be reflected in your table and persist in the backend.
